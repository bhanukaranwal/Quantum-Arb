QuantumArb 2.0 - Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan1. Overview & ObjectivesThis document outlines the Disaster Recovery (DR) plan for the QuantumArb 2.0 platform. The primary goal is to ensure business continuity and meet the stringent resilience requirements of Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Reg-SCI).Key Objectives:Recovery Time Objective (RTO): < 30 seconds. The maximum acceptable time for the system to be unavailable following a major failure event.Recovery Point Objective (RPO): < 1 second. The maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time. Given the nature of HFT, the goal is near-zero data loss for in-flight transactions.2. ScopeThis plan covers all critical components of the QuantumArb 2.0 platform, including:Infrastructure: AWS EKS clusters, networking (VPC, subnets), and co-located hardware (FPGAs, microwave links).Core Services: All microservices (strategy-engine, risk-gateway, worm-logger, etc.).Data Stores: Real-time state stores (e.g., Redis for account state) and persistent audit logs (S3 WORM storage).3. Architecture & StrategyThe DR strategy is based on a geographically distributed, active-active deployment model.Primary Site: AWS us-east-1 (N. Virginia), co-located with the Nasdaq data center.Secondary Site: AWS us-central-1 (Chicago), co-located with the CME data center in Aurora.Both sites run a full, independent instance of the QuantumArb 2.0 stack. A global load balancer or DNS-based routing directs traffic to the nearest or designated primary site.4. Failure Scenarios & Recovery ProceduresScenario 1: Single Microservice FailureDetection: Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes fail.Recovery: Kubernetes automatically restarts the failed pod. If the node is unhealthy, the pod is rescheduled to a healthy node in the cluster.RTO: < 60 seconds (within the DR objective for a minor incident).Scenario 2: Availability Zone (AZ) FailureDetection: AWS Health Dashboard alerts; monitoring systems (e.g., Grafana) report mass unavailability of nodes in a specific AZ.Recovery: The EKS cluster is deployed across multiple AZs. The Kubernetes scheduler automatically moves workloads from the failed AZ to healthy AZs. The Elastic Load Balancer will also stop routing traffic to the failed AZ.RTO: < 5 minutes.Scenario 3: Full Region / Data Center Failure (Major Disaster)Detection: Widespread system failure alarms; loss of connectivity to an entire region.Recovery (Automated Failover):The global DNS routing policy (e.g., AWS Route 53 with health checks) automatically detects the failure of the primary region's endpoints.DNS records are updated to redirect all traffic to the secondary (active) site in the other region.The secondary site, which is already running and processing its local market data, takes over the full trading load.Stateful information (e.g., open positions, account risk) is replicated between regions in near real-time using services like Amazon Aurora Global Database or custom replication logic over the inter-region backbone.RTO: < 30 seconds.5. Testing & MaintenanceThe DR plan is not static. Its effectiveness is validated through continuous, automated testing.Regular DR Drills: A full region failover is simulated quarterly, as mandated by the Reg-SCI dry-run milestone.Chaos Engineering: We use tools like ChaosMesh to continuously inject failures into the production environment (e.g., killing pods, injecting network latency, blocking access to dependencies). This is part of the CI/CD pipeline and ensures that our system's resilience is constantly being tested against real-world failure conditions.This DR plan provides the strategic framework for the platform's resilience. The next logical step is to define the practical experiments for testing it.Would you like to proceed by creating the conceptual plan for our Chaos Engineering experiments?
