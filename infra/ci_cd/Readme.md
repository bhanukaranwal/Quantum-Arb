CI/CD & GitOps PipelineThis directory defines the CI/CD pipeline for QuantumArb 2.0, built on GitHub Actions for automation and ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployments to Kubernetes.Core PrinciplesGit as the Single Source of Truth: All infrastructure and application configurations are declared in this Git repository.Automated & Gated Deployments: Every commit to the main branch triggers an automated workflow that builds, tests, and deploys code. Deployments to production are gated by manual approvals and successful canary analysis.Continuous Verification & Chaos Engineering: The pipeline integrates security scanning, performance testing, and chaos experiments to ensure the stability and integrity of the system.Pipeline WorkflowCommit: A developer pushes code to a feature branch.Pull Request: A pull request triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that:Builds Docker images for the relevant microservices.Runs unit and integration tests.Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.Performs static code analysis.Merge to Main: Upon successful checks and code review, the PR is merged.ArgoCD Sync: The merge updates the Kubernetes manifests in the /infra/k8s directory. ArgoCD detects this change and automatically syncs the state of the cluster to match the configuration in Git.Canary Rollout: For production environments, ArgoCD initiates a canary release, directing a small percentage of live traffic to the new version.Continuous Chaos: ChaosMesh is integrated into the pipeline to run automated chaos experiments (e.g., pod failures, network latency injection) against the canary deployment to validate its resilience before a full rollout.Promote or Rollback: Based on performance metrics (latency, error rates), the new version is either automatically promoted or rolled back.ToolsGitHub Actions: For CI and workflow automation.ArgoCD: For continuous delivery and GitOps management.ChaosMesh: For resilience testing through controlled chaos experiments.
