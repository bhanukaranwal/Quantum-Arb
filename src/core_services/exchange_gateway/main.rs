/*
 * QuantumArb 2.0 - Core Services: Exchange Gateway
 *
 * File: src/core_services/exchange_gateway/main.rs
 *
 * Description:
 * This microservice is responsible for managing direct connectivity to trading
 * venues. It abstracts the specific protocol (e.g., FIX 5.0, binary, WebSocket)
 * of an exchange from the rest of the system.
 *
 * Its primary role is to:
 * 1. Maintain a persistent session with an exchange.
 * 2. Receive approved order requests from the internal system.
 * 3. Translate and send these orders to the exchange in the required format.
 * 4. Receive execution reports from the exchange and publish them back to the
 * internal message bus for consumption by the strategy and risk engines.
 *
 * This POC simulates managing a connection and processing an order lifecycle.
 *
 * To run (with a Cargo.toml file):
 * [dependencies]
 * tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
 * serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
 * serde_json = "1.0"
 * uuid = { version = "1", features = ["v4"] }
 * chrono = "0.4"
