Core Services - Rust MicroservicesThis directory contains the source code for the latency-critical microservices that form the backbone of the QuantumArb 2.0 application logic. These services are developed in Rust to ensure memory safety, high performance, and fearless concurrency, which are paramount in a high-frequency trading environment.They handle functions that are not suitable for the FPGA but still demand low-latency processing, such as complex event processing, strategy management, and exchange connectivity.Key MicroservicesStrategy Engine:Manages the lifecycle of arbitrage strategies.Receives signals from the FPGA's spread calculator and the ML pipeline.Makes high-level decisions on when to enable or disable specific strategies based on market conditions and risk parameters.Exchange Gateway:Manages FIX and native binary connections to various trading venues.Handles session management, order state, and execution reports.For crypto venues, it manages WebSocket connections and data sharding as per exchange specifications (e.g., Binance, Kite).Latency Oracle:Continuously monitors the latency of the dual-path microwave and fiber network links.Provides real-time data to the order routing system to dynamically select the fastest path for order transmission.Data Bus Connector:Subscribes to alternative data streams (e.g., news NLP, satellite imagery analysis, social media sentiment).Normalizes and forwards this data to the ML pipeline for feature engineering.Real-time Monitoring Service:Aggregates and exposes critical system metrics (e.g., P99 latency, message rates, queue depths) to the monitoring dashboard (Grafana).Uses an eBPF exporter to gather fine-grained kernel and network statistics without impacting performance.CommunicationIntra-service Messaging: Services communicate via gRPC for synchronous requests and NATS JetStream for asynchronous, persistent messaging, ensuring P99 latencies under 20 Âµs.CPU Pinning: In the Kubernetes deployment, the pods for these critical services are pinned to isolated CPU cores to prevent jitter and context-switching delays from other processes.
