AI/ML & Quantum PipelineThis directory contains all components related to the machine learning and quantum computing research pipelines for QuantumArb 2.0. The goal is to develop predictive models that can identify and act on arbitrage opportunities faster and more accurately than traditional methods.Machine Learning StackData Ingestion & Feature Engineering:Receives normalized data from the core_services (market data, alternative data).Uses AWS SageMaker Data Wrangler and Dask on Spot Fleets for large-scale feature engineering.Model Training & Backtesting:Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL): Policies are trained using Ray RLlib within a custom gym-style environment. This simulator is seeded with historical L2 tick data to accurately model market dynamics.Transfer Learning: Online learning techniques are used to continuously adapt the models to new market regimes without starting from scratch.Backtesting: Large-scale backtests are performed using XGBoost and other models, orchestrated with SageMaker Pipelines and scaled with Dask/Coiled.Inference & Deployment:Primary Inference: Trained models are deployed as endpoints in SageMaker for use by the Strategy Engine microservice.On-FPGA Inference: For extremely short-horizon signals (e.g., microstructure patterns), lightweight models are compiled and deployed directly onto the FPGA fabric in the hw_fpga layer, operating within a 5Âµs latency budget.Interpretability: SHAP and other XAI (Explainable AI) techniques are used to interpret model predictions, ensuring transparency and trust in the AI's decisions.Quantum Research SandboxThis part of the pipeline is dedicated to exploring the potential of quantum computing for solving complex financial problems that are intractable for classical computers.Quantum Algorithms: Prototyping of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for portfolio optimization and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) for advanced strategy development.Integration: The sandbox is integrated with Google's Cirq and AWS Braket, providing access to quantum circuit simulators and real quantum hardware from providers like D-Wave and Oxford Quantum Circuits.Use Cases: Initial research focuses on using quantum techniques for advanced Monte Carlo risk simulations and finding optimal arbitrage paths across a large number of assets.
