Hardware Acceleration - FPGA KernelsThis directory contains the source code for the FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic, which is the cornerstone of QuantumArb's ultra-low-latency performance. The logic is implemented in a combination of Verilog for maximum control and High-Level Synthesis (HLS) using C++ for complex algorithms.These kernels are responsible for handling the entire tick-to-trade lifecycle in hardware, bypassing the server's CPU and operating system for deterministic, nanosecond-level processing.Key ModulesOrder Book Management: A hardware-based order book that is updated directly from the raw market data feed (e.g., ITCH). It maintains the current state of the market for multiple instruments.Spread Calculator: An on-chip module that calculates arbitrage spreads between different venues in real-time as new ticks arrive.IOC/FOK Order Router: A finite-state machine (FSM) that generates and sends Immediate-Or-Cancel (IOC) or Fill-Or-Kill (FOK) orders based on signals from the spread calculator.DMA Engine: A Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller that provides a zero-copy data path between the NIC and the FPGA, and between the FPGA and the host system's memory for logging and monitoring.Pre-Trade Risk Gateway: A side-channel risk module that performs pre-trade checks (e.g., fat-finger, max order value) in hardware before an order is sent to the exchange.Lightweight ML Inference: A dedicated area for deploying simple, low-latency inference models directly on the FPGA fabric for predictive signals that require a response time of <= 5Âµs.Technology StackLanguage: Verilog, SystemVerilog, C++ (for HLS)Tools: Xilinx Vivado Design Suite, Intel Quartus PrimeVerification: Formal verification methods are used to prove the correctness of the order matching and risk control state machines.
