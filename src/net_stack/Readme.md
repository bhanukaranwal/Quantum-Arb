Low-Latency Network StackThis directory contains the source code for the custom network stack of QuantumArb 2.0. Its primary purpose is to achieve ultra-low-latency network I/O by completely bypassing the operating system's kernel for all trading-related network traffic. This is essential for receiving market data and sending orders with deterministic, microsecond-level precision.Key ComponentsKernel-Bypass Drivers: Custom drivers and configurations for high-performance NICs (e.g., Solarflare, Mellanox) using frameworks like DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) and eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter). These drivers allow user-space applications to interact directly with the network hardware.Zero-Copy Buffers: Implementation of ring buffers for zero-copy data transfer. Market data packets are read directly from the NIC's memory into a user-space buffer that is shared with the FPGA's DMA engine, eliminating memory copy overhead.Packet Timestamping: Hardware-level timestamping of incoming and outgoing packets. This is synchronized with the PTP grandmaster clock to provide nanosecond-level accuracy for latency measurement and feedback loops.Binary Protocol Parsers: Highly optimized parsers for native exchange protocols (e.g., ITCH/PILLAR/SAIL) and FIX 5.0 SP2. These parsers are designed to decode messages with minimal computational overhead.Technology StackPrimary Frameworks: DPDK, eBPF, XDP (Xpress Data Path)Supported Hardware: Solarflare Onload, AMD TCPDirect, Mellanox VMAProgramming Language: C, C++Auto-TuningThe stack includes an auto-tuning engine that dynamically adjusts parameters like interrupt affinity, polling strategies, and buffer sizes based on real-time network conditions and application feedback to maintain optimal performance.
