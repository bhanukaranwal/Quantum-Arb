Risk, Compliance, and AuditingThis directory contains the components responsible for risk management, regulatory compliance, and system integrity for QuantumArb 2.0. In a high-frequency trading environment, robust, real-time risk controls are not just a feature—they are a fundamental requirement for survival and regulatory approval.Pre-Trade Risk ManagementFPGA-Based Controls: The first line of defense is implemented directly in hardware. A side-channel on the FPGA runs pre-trade risk checks in parallel with the order-routing logic. This includes:Fat-finger checks: Validates order size and price against instrument-specific thresholds.VaR (Value-at-Risk) Models: Checks if a new order would breach portfolio-level risk limits.Pattern Detection: Identifies and blocks potentially manipulative trading patterns.Kill Switch: A hardware-level kill switch that can be triggered manually or automatically to immediately halt all trading activity from a specific FPGA or across the entire system.Post-Trade Surveillance & ComplianceReal-time Audit Trail: Every single action—from receiving a market data packet to sending an order and receiving an execution report—is timestamped with nanosecond precision and logged.WORM Storage: All trade and audit data is written to a WORM (Write-Once, Read-Many) store, compliant with SEC Rule 17a-4. This ensures that records are immutable and can be retrieved for regulatory audits.FIX Drop-Copy: A real-time FIX 5.0 SP2 drop-copy feed of all order activity is provided to clearing firms and regulatory bodies as required.FINRA Rule 3110 Compliance: The system includes tools for post-trade surveillance to detect and report suspicious trading activity, adhering to FINRA's supervision rules.System Integrity & Resilience (Reg-SCI)QuantumArb 2.0 is designed to meet the stringent requirements of Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Reg-SCI).Continuous Chaos Testing: We practice "GameDay" scenarios regularly, using ChaosMesh to inject failures (e.g., network partitions, pod deletions, data center failovers) into the production environment in a controlled manner. This continuously validates the system's resilience and disaster recovery capabilities.Deterministic Replay Harness: The system includes a testing harness that can replay historical market data (from PCAP files) with nanosecond-level accuracy. This is used to deterministically reproduce and debug any past trading incidents.High-Availability Clusters: Active-active clusters are deployed in geographically distinct locations (e.g., Nasdaq AWS co-lo and CME Aurora) to ensure failover in under 30 seconds.
