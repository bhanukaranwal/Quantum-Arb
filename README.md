QuantumArb 2.0 – Ultra-Low-Latency, AI-Enhanced Arbitrage PlatformWelcome to the QuantumArb 2.0 project. This repository contains the source code for a next-generation high-frequency trading (HFT) platform designed for ultra-low-latency, cross-asset arbitrage. The system leverages FPGA acceleration, kernel-bypass networking, AI-driven predictive analytics, and a quantum-ready research environment to achieve deterministic performance at the bleeding edge of financial technology.Project OverviewQuantumArb 2.0 is architected to execute arbitrage strategies across equities, cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange (FX), and derivatives with end-to-end latencies under 100 microseconds. It is a cloud-native system built on a microservice architecture, designed for resilience, scalability, and compliance with stringent regulatory standards.Key FeaturesSub-100µs Latency: FPGA-accelerated order processing and kernel-bypass networking for tick-to-trade speeds.AI-Driven Predictions: A deep reinforcement learning layer for market prediction and strategy optimization.Quantum-Ready Sandbox: An integrated environment for prototyping quantum algorithms (QAOA, QRL) for future financial modeling.Robust Risk Management: Real-time, hardware-level risk controls and compliance with Reg-SCI and Market Access Rule requirements.Cloud-Native & Resilient: A containerized microservice mesh orchestrated with Kubernetes, ensuring high availability and rapid, safe deployments.Repository StructureThis repository is organized into two main directories: src for the application source code and infra for the infrastructure-as-code..

Getting StartedDetailed setup instructions for each component can be found in the respective subdirectories. A high-level overview of the setup process is as follows:Hardware Setup: Provision and configure FPGA development boards and compatible NICs.Infrastructure Deployment: Use Terraform to provision the cloud and co-location infrastructure.Kubernetes Cluster: Deploy the Kubernetes cluster and service mesh using the provided Helm charts.Service Deployment: Build and deploy the microservices using the CI/CD pipeline.ContributingContributions are welcome. Please adhere to the project's coding standards and submit pull requests for review. All contributors must follow the FINRA algorithmic trading governance checklists.LicensingThe core of QuantumArb 2.0 is open-source under the Apache 2.0 License.
